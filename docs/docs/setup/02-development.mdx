This guide provides an overview of how to work with the development environment for this project,
including helpful tooling, commands, and recommended workflows.

## Testing code

We currently do not have any tests :( But you can at least lint and reformat Python code using the
following commands:

```bash
ruff check
ruff format
```

You can also apply fixes automatically:

```bash
ruff check --fix
```

## Updating dependencies

1) Add a new Python dependency:

    ```bash
    uv add package==<version>
    ```

2) Commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
    ```

To update the version of an existing transitive dependency, you can use `uv lock --upgrade-package <package>=<version>`.

## Contributing

If you're collaborating with others:

- Keep your local branch updated with the main branch.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests.
- Use descriptive titles and summaries.
- Include configuration updates if they affect the development environment.
