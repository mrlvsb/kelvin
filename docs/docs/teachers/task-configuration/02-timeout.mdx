The `timeout` action allows you to set a maximum time limit for the execution of student submissions.
This is useful to prevent infinite loops or excessively long-running processes that could consume server resources.

Timeout consumes a time string format, which can include:

- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours

Examples: `30s` for 30 seconds, `5m` for 5 minutes

```yaml title="config.yml"
timeout: <time_string>   # eq. "5m"
```
