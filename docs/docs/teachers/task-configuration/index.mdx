# Task configuration

By default, task configuration is **not required** in assignment. But by its implementation,
you are able to execute post-processing tasks after the assignment is submitted by student.

## Example configuration file

This example configuration is only for demonstration purposes. You can find more details about each pipeline type
in separate documentation tabs.

```yml title="config.yml"
# https://github.com/mrlvsb/kelvin/blob/master/README.pipeline.md
# You can also use CTRL+Space for autocompleting

# Specify the queue where the evaluation will be processed
queue: "evaluator"

# Max time for whole evaluation process
timeout: "15m"

# TODO: Add example tests
tests:

# Define the evaluation pipeline
pipeline:
  # Compile submitted source codes with gcc
  - type: gcc
    flags: -Wall -Wextra -g -fsanitize=address -lm -Wno-unused-variable

  # Runs clang-tidy static analysis and add warnings as comments
  - type: clang-tidy
    checks: '*'

  # Run configured tests
  - type: tests

  # Automatically propose points from the test results
  - type: auto_grader
    propose: true

# Manage resource limits
limits:
  fsize: 5M     # max filesize
  wall-time: 5  # max 5 seconds per test
  cg-mem: 5M    # max 5MB of memory usage

# Enable asynchronous tasks after evaluation
async:
  # LLM is module for automatic feedback generation using Large Language Models
  llm:
    enabled: false
    language: en
    model: gpt-4                      # Overwrite default model
    prompt_name: strict_code_review   # Use custom prompt
```
