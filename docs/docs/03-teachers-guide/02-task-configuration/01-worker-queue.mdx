The `queue` action allows you to configure a queue system for handling submissions. This is particularly useful
for assignments requires hardware resource access or long processing times.

For example, by compiling **cuda**, you most likely want to run this on a machine with a compatible GPU.

```yaml title="config.yml"
queue: <queue_name>   # eq. "cuda", "evaluator" (default)
```
