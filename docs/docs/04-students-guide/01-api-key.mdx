An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests associated with your account as student.
For security reasons, you should keep your API key private and not share it publicly.

Click [Create API Token](https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz/api_token) to generate your API key.

## Using the API key

To use the API key, include it in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests. The format should be as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz
```

```py
import requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
}
response = requests.get("https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz", headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```
